# Layout animations

Motion's industry-leading layout animations makes it easy to animate between
any two layouts, even between different elements.

It's as simple as a `layout` prop.

    
    
    <motion.div layout />

> _ ~ Josh W. Comeau, [The Joy of
> React](https://www.joyofreact.com/?referredBy=motion)

This little prop can animate previously unanimatable CSS values, like
switching `justify-content` between `flex-start` and `flex-end`.

    
    
    <motion.div
      layout
      style={{ justifyContent: isOn ? "flex-start" : "flex-end" }}
    />

Or by using the `layoutId` prop, it's possible to match two elements and
animate between them for some truly advanced animations.

    
    
    <motion.li layoutId="item" />

It can handle anything from microinteractions to full page transitions.

## Usage

Any layout change that happens as a result of a React re-render can be
animated.

    
    
    <motion.div layout style={{ width: isOpen ? "80vw" : 0 }} />

Note that CSS changes should happen immediately via `style`, not `animate`, as
`layout` will take care of the animation.

Layout changes can be anything, changing `width`/`height`, number of grid
columns, reordering a list, or adding/removing new items:

### Shared layout animations

When a new component is added that has a `layoutId` prop that matches an
existing component, it will automatically animate out from the old component.

    
    
    isSelected && <motion.div layoutId="underline" />

If the old component is still mounted when the new component enters, they will
automatically crossfade from the old to the new.

When removing an element to animate back to its origin layout,
`[AnimatePresence](./react-animate-presence)` can be used to keep it in the
DOM until its exit animation has finished.

    
    
    <AnimatePresence>
      {isOpen && <motion.div layoutId="modal" />}
    </AnimatePresence>

### Setting a transition

Layout animations can be customised using [the ](./react-
transitions)`[transition](./react-transitions)`[ prop](./react-transitions).

    
    
    <motion.div layout transition={{ duration: 0.3 }} />

If you want to set a transition specifically for **only** the layout
animation, you can specify a specific `layout` transition.

    
    
    <motion.div
      layout
      animate={{ opacity: 0.5 }}
      transition={{
        default: { ease: "linear" },
        layout: { duration: 0.3 }
      }}
    />

When performing a shared layout animation, the transition defined for element
we're animating **to** will be used.

    
    
    <>
      <motion.button
        layoutId="modal"
        onClick={() => setIsOpen(true)}
        // This transition will be used when the modal closes
        transition={{ type: "spring" }}
      >
        Open
      </motion.button>
      <AnimatePresence>
        {isOn && (
          <motion.dialog
            layoutId="modal"
            // This transition will be used when the modal opens
            transition={{ duration: 0.3 }}
          />
        )}
      </AnimatePresence>
    </>

### Animating within scrollable element

To correctly animate layout within scrollable elements, we need to provide
them the `layoutScroll` prop.

    
    
    <motion.div layoutScroll style={{ overflow: "scroll" }} />

This lets Motion account for the element's scroll offset when measuring
children.

### Animating within fixed containers

To correctly animate layout within fixed elements, we need to provide them the
`layoutRoot` prop.

    
    
    <motion.div layoutRoot style={{ position: "fixed" }} />

This lets Motion account for the page's scroll offset when measuring children.

### Group layout animations

Layout animations are triggered when a component re-renders and its layout has
changed.

    
    
    function Accordion() {
      const [isOpen, setOpen] = useState(false)
      
      return (
        <motion.div
          layout
          style={{ height: isOpen ? "100px" : "500px" }}
          onClick={() => setOpen(!isOpen)}
        />
      )
    }

But what happens when we have two or more components that don't re-render at
the same time, but **do** affect each other's layout?

    
    
    function List() {
      return (
        <>
          <Accordion />
          <Accordion />
        </>  
      )
    }

When one re-renders, for performance reasons the other won't be able to detect
changes to its layout.

We can synchronise layout changes across multiple components by wrapping them
in the `[LayoutGroup component](./react-layout-group)`.

    
    
    import { LayoutGroup } from "motion/react"
    
    function List() {
      return (
        <LayoutGroup>
          <Accordion />
          <Accordion />
        </LayoutGroup>  
      )
    }

When layout changes are detected in any grouped `motion` component, layout
animations will trigger across all of them.

### Scale correction

All layout animations are performed using the `transform` style, resulting in
smooth framerates.

Animating layout using transforms can sometimes visually distort children. To
correct this distortion, the first child elements of the element can also be
given `layout` property.

Open this sandbox and try removing `layout` from the pink dot to see the
difference this will make:

Transforms can also distort `boxShadow` and `borderRadius`. The `motion`
component will automatically correct this distortion on both props, as long as
they're set as motion values.

If you're not animating these values, the easiest way to do this is to set
them via `style`.

    
    
    <motion.div layout style={{ borderRadius: 20 }} />

## Troubleshooting

### The component isn't animating

Ensure the component is **not** set to `display: inline`, as browsers don't
apply `transform` to these elements.

Ensure the component is re-rendering when you expect the layout animation to
start.

### Animations don't work during window resize

Layout animations are blocked during window resize to improve performance and
to prevent unnecessary animations.

### SVG layout animations are broken

SVG components aren't currently supported with layout animations. SVGs don't
have layout systems so it's recommended to directly animate their attributes
like `cx` etc.

### The content stretches undesirably

This is a natural side-effect of animating `width` and `height` with `scale`.

Often, this can be fixed by providing these elements a `layout` animation and
they'll be scale-corrected.

    
    
    <motion.section layout>
      <motion.img layout />
    </motion.section>

Some elements, like images or text that are changing between different aspect
ratios, might be better animated with `layout="position"`.

### Border radius or box shadows are behaving strangely

Animating `scale` is performant but can distort some styles like `border-
radius` and `box-shadow`.

Motion automatically corrects for scale distortion on these properties, but
they must be set on the element via `style`.

    
    
    <motion.div layout style={{ borderRadius: 20 }} />

### Border looks stretched during animation

Elements with a `border` may look stretched during the animation. This is for
two reasons:

  1. Because changing `border` triggers layout recalculations, it defeats the performance benefits of animating via `transform`. You might as well animate `width` and `height` classically.

  2. `border` can't render smaller than `1px`, which limits the degree of scale correction that Motion can perform on this style.

A work around is to replace `border` with a parent element with padding that
acts as a `border`.

    
    
    <motion.div layout style={{ borderRadius: 10, padding: 5 }}>
      <motion.div layout style={{ borderRadius: 5 }} />
    </motion.div>

## Technical reading

Interested in the technical details behind layout animations? Nanda does an
incredible job of [explaining the challenges](https://www.nan.fyi/magic-
motion) of animating layout with transforms using interactive examples. Matt,
creator of Motion, did a [talk at Vercel
conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-JIu0u42Jc&ab_channel=Vercel)
about the implementation details that is largely up to date.

## Differences with the View Transitions API

More browsers are starting to support the [View Transitions
API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transitions_API),
which is similar to Motion's layout animations.

### Benefits of View Transitions API

The main two benefits of View Transitions is that **it's included in
browsers** and **features a unique rendering system**.

#### Filesize

Because the View Transitions API is already included in browsers, it's cheap
to implement very simple crossfade animations.

However, the CSS complexity can scale quite quickly. Motion's layout
animations are around 12kb but from there it's very cheap to change
transitions, add springs, mark matching

#### Rendering

Whereas Motion animates the elements as they exist on the page, View
Transitions API does something quite unique in that it takes an image snapshot
of the previous page state, and crossfades it with a live view of the new page
state.

For shared elements, it does the same thing, taking little image snapshots and
then crossfading those with a live view of the element's new state.

This can be leveraged to create interesting effects like full-screen wipes
that aren't really in the scope of layout animations. [Framer's Page
Effects](https://www.framer.com/academy/lessons/page-effects) were built with
the View Transitions API and it also extensively uses layout animations. The
right tool for the right job.

### Drawbacks to View Transitions API

There are quite a few drawbacks to the API vs layout animations:

  * **Not interruptible** : Interrupting an animation mid-way will snap the animation to the end before starting the next one. This feels very janky.

  * **Blocks interaction** : The animating elements overlay the "real" page underneath and block pointer events. Makes things feel quite sticky.

  * **Difficult to manage IDs** : Layout animations allow more than one element with a `layoutId` whereas View Transitions will break if the previous element isn't removed.

  * **Less performant:** View Transitions take an actual screenshot and animate via `width`/`height` vs layout animation's `transform`. This is measurably less performant when animating many elements.

  * **Doesn't account for scroll** : If the page scroll changes during a view transition, elements will incorrectly animate this delta.

  * **No relative animations:** If a nested element has a `delay` it will get "left behind" when its parent animates away, whereas Motion handles this kind of relative animation.

  * **One animation at a time** : View Transitions animate the whole screen, which means combining it with other animations is difficult and other view animations impossible.

All-in-all, each system offers something different and each might be a better
fit for your needs. In the future it might be that Motion also offers an API
based on View Transitions API.

Motion's industry-leading layout animations makes it easy to animate between
any two layouts, even between different elements.

It's as simple as a `layout` prop.

    <motion.div layout transition={{ duration: 0.3 }} />

        layout: { duration: 0.3 }
      }}
    />

When performing a shared layout animation, the transition defined for element
we're animating **to** will be used.

    
    
    <>
      <motion.button
        layoutId="modal"

        // This transition will be used when the modal closes
        transition={{ type: "spring" }}
      >
        Open
      </motion.button>
      <AnimatePresence>
        {isOn && (
          <motion.dialog
            layoutId="modal"
            // This transition will be used when the modal opens
            transition={{ duration: 0.3 }}
          />
        )}
      </AnimatePresence>
    </>

### Animating within scrollable element

To correctly animate layout within scrollable elements, we need to provide
them the `layoutScroll` prop.

    
    
    <motion.div layoutScroll style={{ overflow: "scroll" }} />

This lets Motion account for the element's scroll offset when measuring
children.

### Animating within fixed containers

To correctly animate layout within fixed elements, we need to provide them the
`layoutRoot` prop.

    
    
    <motion.div layoutRoot style={{ position: "fixed" }} />

This lets Motion account for the page's scroll offset when measuring children.

### Group layout animations

Layout animations are triggered when a component re-renders and its layout has
changed.

    
    
    function Accordion() {
      const [isOpen, setOpen] = useState(false)
      
      return (
        <motion.div
          layout
          style={{ height: isOpen ? "100px" : "500px" }}
          onClick={() => setOpen(!isOpen)}
        />
      )
    }

But what happens when we have two or more components that don't re-render at
the same time, but **do** affect each other's layout?

    
    
    function List() {
      return (
        <>
          <Accordion />
          <Accordion />
        </>  
      )
    }

When one re-renders, for performance reasons the other won't be able to detect
changes to its layout.

We can synchronise layout changes across multiple components by wrapping them
in the `[LayoutGroup component](./react-layout-group)`.

    
    
    import { LayoutGroup } from "motion/react"
    
    function List() {
      return (
        <LayoutGroup>
          <Accordion />
          <Accordion />
        </LayoutGroup>  
      )
    }

When layout changes are detected in any grouped `motion` component, layout
animations will trigger across all of them.

switching `justify-content` between `flex-start` and `flex-end`.

    
    
    <motion.div
      layout
      style={{ justifyContent: isOn ? "flex-start" : "flex-end" }}
    />

Or by using the `layoutId` prop, it's possible to match two elements and
animate between them for some truly advanced animations.

    
    
    <motion.li layoutId="item" />

It can handle anything from microinteractions to full page transitions.

## Usage

Any layout change that happens as a result of a React re-render can be
animated.

    
    
    <motion.div layout style={{ width: isOpen ? "80vw" : 0 }} />

Note that CSS changes should happen immediately via `style`, not `animate`, as
`layout` will take care of the animation.

Layout changes can be anything, changing `width`/`height`, number of grid
columns, reordering a list, or adding/removing new items:

### Shared layout animations

When a new component is added that has a `layoutId` prop that matches an
existing component, it will automatically animate out from the old component.

    
    
    isSelected && <motion.div layoutId="underline" />

If the old component is still mounted when the new component enters, they will
automatically crossfade from the old to the new.

When removing an element to animate back to its origin layout,
`[AnimatePresence](./react-animate-presence)` can be used to keep it in the
DOM until its exit animation has finished.

    
    
    <AnimatePresence>
      {isOpen && <motion.div layoutId="modal" />}
    </AnimatePresence>

### Setting a transition

Layout animations can be customised using [the ](./react-
transitions)`[transition](./react-transitions)`[ prop](./react-transitions).

    
    
    <motion.div layout transition={{ duration: 0.3 }} />

If you want to set a transition specifically for **only** the layout
animation, you can specify a specific `layout` transition.

    
    
    <motion.div
      layout
      animate={{ opacity: 0.5 }}
      transition={{
        default: { ease: "linear" },
        layout: { duration: 0.3 }
      }}
    />

When performing a shared layout animation, the transition defined for element
we're animating **to** will be used.

    
    
    <>
      <motion.button
        layoutId="modal"
        onClick={() => setIsOpen(true)}
        // This transition will be used when the modal closes
        transition={{ type: "spring" }}
      >
        Open
      </motion.button>
      <AnimatePresence>
        {isOn && (
          <motion.dialog
            layoutId="modal"
            // This transition will be used when the modal opens
            transition={{ duration: 0.3 }}
          />
        )}
      </AnimatePresence>
    </>

### Animating within scrollable element

To correctly animate layout within scrollable elements, we need to provide
them the `layoutScroll` prop.

    
    
    <motion.div layoutScroll style={{ overflow: "scroll" }} />

This lets Motion account for the element's scroll offset when measuring
children.

### Animating within fixed containers

To correctly animate layout within fixed elements, we need to provide them the
`layoutRoot` prop.

    
    
    <motion.div layoutRoot style={{ position: "fixed" }} />

This lets Motion account for the page's scroll offset when measuring children.

### Group layout animations

Layout animations are triggered when a component re-renders and its layout has
changed.

    
    
    function Accordion() {
      const [isOpen, setOpen] = useState(false)
      
      return (
        <motion.div
          layout
          style={{ height: isOpen ? "100px" : "500px" }}
          onClick={() => setOpen(!isOpen)}
        />
      )
    }

But what happens when we have two or more components that don't re-render at
the same time, but **do** affect each other's layout?

    
    
    function List() {
      return (
        <>
          <Accordion />
          <Accordion />
        </>  
      )
    }

When one re-renders, for performance reasons the other won't be able to detect
changes to its layout.

We can synchronise layout changes across multiple components by wrapping them
in the `[LayoutGroup component](./react-layout-group)`.

    
    
    import { LayoutGroup } from "motion/react"
    
    function List() {
      return (
        <LayoutGroup>
          <Accordion />
          <Accordion />
        </LayoutGroup>  
      )
    }

When layout changes are detected in any grouped `motion` component, layout
animations will trigger across all of them.

### Scale correction

All layout animations are performed using the `transform` style, resulting in
smooth framerates.

Animating layout using transforms can sometimes visually distort children. To
correct this distortion, the first child elements of the element can also be
given `layout` property.

Open this sandbox and try removing `layout` from the pink dot to see the
difference this will make:

Transforms can also distort `boxShadow` and `borderRadius`. The `motion`
component will automatically correct this distortion on both props, as long as
they're set as motion values.

If you're not animating these values, the easiest way to do this is to set
them via `style`.

    
    
    <motion.div layout style={{ borderRadius: 20 }} />

## Troubleshooting

### The component isn't animating

Ensure the component is **not** set to `display: inline`, as browsers don't
apply `transform` to these elements.

Ensure the component is re-rendering when you expect the layout animation to
start.

### Animations don't work during window resize

Layout animations are blocked during window resize to improve performance and
to prevent unnecessary animations.

### SVG layout animations are broken

SVG components aren't currently supported with layout animations. SVGs don't
have layout systems so it's recommended to directly animate their attributes
like `cx` etc.

### The content stretches undesirably

This is a natural side-effect of animating `width` and `height` with `scale`.

Often, this can be fixed by providing these elements a `layout` animation and
they'll be scale-corrected.

    
    
    <motion.section layout>
      <motion.img layout />
    </motion.section>

Some elements, like images or text that are changing between different aspect
ratios, might be better animated with `layout="position"`.

### Border radius or box shadows are behaving strangely

Animating `scale` is performant but can distort some styles like `border-
radius` and `box-shadow`.

Motion automatically corrects for scale distortion on these properties, but
they must be set on the element via `style`.

    
    
    <motion.div layout style={{ borderRadius: 20 }} />

### Border looks stretched during animation

Elements with a `border` may look stretched during the animation. This is for
two reasons:

  1. Because changing `border` triggers layout recalculations, it defeats the performance benefits of animating via `transform`. You might as well animate `width` and `height` classically.

  2. `border` can't render smaller than `1px`, which limits the degree of scale correction that Motion can perform on this style.

A work around is to replace `border` with a parent element with padding that
acts as a `border`.

    
    
    <motion.div layout style={{ borderRadius: 10, padding: 5 }}>
      <motion.div layout style={{ borderRadius: 5 }} />
    </motion.div>

## Technical reading

Interested in the technical details behind layout animations? Nanda does an
incredible job of [explaining the challenges](https://www.nan.fyi/magic-
motion) of animating layout with transforms using interactive examples. Matt,
creator of Motion, did a [talk at Vercel
conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-JIu0u42Jc&ab_channel=Vercel)
about the implementation details that is largely up to date.

## Differences with the View Transitions API

More browsers are starting to support the [View Transitions
API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transitions_API),
which is similar to Motion's layout animations.

### Benefits of View Transitions API

The main two benefits of View Transitions is that **it's included in
browsers** and **features a unique rendering system**.

#### Filesize

Because the View Transitions API is already included in browsers, it's cheap
to implement very simple crossfade animations.

However, the CSS complexity can scale quite quickly. Motion's layout
animations are around 12kb but from there it's very cheap to change
transitions, add springs, mark matching

#### Rendering

Whereas Motion animates the elements as they exist on the page, View
Transitions API does something quite unique in that it takes an image snapshot
of the previous page state, and crossfades it with a live view of the new page
state.

For shared elements, it does the same thing, taking little image snapshots and
then crossfading those with a live view of the element's new state.

This can be leveraged to create interesting effects like full-screen wipes
that aren't really in the scope of layout animations. [Framer's Page
Effects](https://www.framer.com/academy/lessons/page-effects) were built with
the View Transitions API and it also extensively uses layout animations. The
right tool for the right job.

### Drawbacks to View Transitions API

There are quite a few drawbacks to the API vs layout animations:

  * **Not interruptible** : Interrupting an animation mid-way will snap the animation to the end before starting the next one. This feels very janky.

  * **Blocks interaction** : The animating elements overlay the "real" page underneath and block pointer events. Makes things feel quite sticky.

  * **Difficult to manage IDs** : Layout animations allow more than one element with a `layoutId` whereas View Transitions will break if the previous element isn't removed.

  * **Less performant:** View Transitions take an actual screenshot and animate via `width`/`height` vs layout animation's `transform`. This is measurably less performant when animating many elements.

  * **Doesn't account for scroll** : If the page scroll changes during a view transition, elements will incorrectly animate this delta.

  * **No relative animations:** If a nested element has a `delay` it will get "left behind" when its parent animates away, whereas Motion handles this kind of relative animation.

  * **One animation at a time** : View Transitions animate the whole screen, which means combining it with other animations is difficult and other view animations impossible.

All-in-all, each system offers something different and each might be a better
fit for your needs. In the future it might be that Motion also offers an API
based on View Transitions API.
