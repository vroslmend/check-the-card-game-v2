/**
 * Socket.IO Server Tests
 * 
 * These tests would verify that the Socket.IO server:
 * 
 * 1. Correctly handles player connections and disconnections
 * 2. Creates and manages game instances properly
 * 3. Routes events to the appropriate game machine instances
 * 4. Broadcasts game state updates to the right clients
 * 5. Manages error handling and recovery
 * 
 * To implement these tests, we would need to:
 * 1. Mock Socket.IO client and server
 * 2. Create test utilities for simulating socket connections and events
 * 3. Verify that the socket handlers process events properly
 * 
 * This would require a more sophisticated test setup with socket mocking,
 * which is beyond the scope of our current task.
