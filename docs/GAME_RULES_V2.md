# **Check! - Official Game Rules (v2.0)**

## **1. Introduction**

Welcome to Check!, a fast-paced card game of strategy, memory, and luck. The goal is to minimize the value of cards in your hand by strategically swapping, discarding, and matching cards. Be the first to confidently "Call Check!" or catch others with high scores when the round ends. This document outlines the official and complete rules of play.

## **2. Game Objective**

Be the player with the **lowest total card value** in your hand at the end of the round.

## **3. Game Components**

*   **The Draw Pile:** A face-down pile of cards from which players draw.
*   **The Discard Pile:** A face-up pile where cards are discarded. The top card is always visible.
*   **Player Hand (Grid):** Each player has a personal set of cards, initially four, arranged face-down in a 2x2 grid.

## **4. The Deck & Card Values**

A standard 52-card deck (no Jokers) is used. Cards are scored as follows:
*   **Ace (A):** -1 point
*   **Number Cards (2-10):** Face value (e.g., '7' is 7 points)
*   **Jack (J):** 11 points
*   **Queen (Q):** 12 points
*   **King (K):** 13 points

## **5. Game Setup**

1.  **Joining a Game:** Players join a game lobby before it begins.
2.  **Starting the Game:** The Game Master initiates the start of the game. *The moment the game starts, the lobby is locked, and no new players may join.*
3.  **Dealing:** The deck is shuffled. Each player is dealt four cards, placed face-down in a 2x2 grid. These cards form the player's starting hand.
4.  **Initial Peek Phase:** After cards are dealt, each player is allowed to secretly look at their **bottom two cards** only (the cards in the second row of their 2x2 grid). After this phase, all cards are turned face-down again.

## **6. The Turn - A Player's Actions**

Turns proceed sequentially around the table. A player's turn consists of one mandatory **Draw Action**, which is then followed by a discard. This discard triggers the **Matching Stage**.

#### **A. The Draw Action**
The current player **must** perform one of the following two actions:

**Action 1: Draw from the Draw Pile**
1.  Take the top card from the face-down Draw Pile. This card is visible only to the drawing player.
2.  The player now has two choices:
    *   **Option A: Swap & Discard.** The player selects one card from their hand and places the newly drawn card face-down in its position. The card that was originally in that position is then placed face-up on top of the Discard Pile.
    *   **Option B: Discard Drawn Card.** The player immediately places the newly drawn card face-up on top of the Discard Pile. This does not alter the player's hand.
    
**Action 2: Draw from the Discard Pile**
1.  This action is only possible if the Discard Pile is **not sealed** (see Section 7 for details on a sealed pile).
2.  A player **cannot** draw a special card (King, Queen, or Jack) from the Discard Pile.
3.  If the top card is drawable, the player takes it. They **must** then swap this card with one card from their hand, placing the discard pile card face-down in their grid. The card from their hand is then placed face-up on the Discard Pile.

_**Note on Special Cards:** If a King, Queen, or Jack is drawn from the deck and swapped into a player's hand, its ability does not trigger at that moment. An ability only triggers when a special card is **discarded** from a player's hand onto the Discard Pile._

#### **B. End of Turn**
After a player discards a card (completing their Draw Action), the game enters **The Matching Stage**. Once the Matching Stage and any resulting Special Abilities are fully resolved, the turn passes to the next player.

## **7. The Matching Stage**

This is a timed, real-time event that occurs immediately after *any* card is discarded.

*   **Trigger:** A card being placed face-up on the Discard Pile.
*   **Objective:** To discard a card of the **exact same rank** from your hand onto the newly discarded card.
*   **Participants:** Any player who is **not locked**, including the player who just discarded the card.

#### **Mechanics of Matching**
1.  **Timer:** A short timer (e.g., 5 seconds) begins the moment the opportunity starts.
2.  **Attempting a Match:** Any eligible player can select a card from their hand and play it to attempt a match.
3.  **Passing:** Any eligible player can choose to **Pass**. *The decision to Pass is final for that specific matching opportunity.* The player cannot attempt a match after passing.
4.  **Ending the Stage:** The Matching Stage ends as soon as one of the following occurs:
    *   A player makes a **successful match**.
    *   All eligible players have manually **passed**.
    *   The **timer expires**. (This counts as a "Pass" for any player who has not acted).

#### **Outcomes of Matching**
*   **Successful Match:**
    1.  The first player to play a card of the correct rank succeeds.
    2.  The matching card is removed from their hand and placed on the Discard Pile. Their hand size is reduced by one.
    3.  The Discard Pile is now considered **"sealed."** A sealed pile cannot be drawn from. It remains sealed until the start of the next player's turn or until another action unseals it.
    4.  If the matched pair consists of two Special Cards (e.g., a King on a King), this triggers a LIFO ability stack (see Section 8.B).
    5.  If a player's hand becomes empty as a result of a successful match, they have automatically **Called "Check"** (see Section 9.B).

*   **Failed Match (Penalty):**
    1.  If a player attempts to match with a card of the wrong rank, the attempt fails.
    2.  **Penalty:** The player must immediately **draw one (1) card** from the Draw Pile and add it to their hand. The invalid card returns to their hand.
    3.  The matching opportunity then **continues** for all other eligible players until the stage ends. The penalized player may attempt to match again if they have another valid card.

## **8. Special Card Abilities**

Abilities are triggered when a Special Card (King, Queen, or Jack) is discarded to the top of the Discard Pile. This can happen during a player's normal turn or as part of a successful match. The game enters an "Ability Resolution" phase to handle them.

*   **King (K):** Peek at any **two** cards on the table (your own or an opponent's). Then, swap any **one** card on the table with any **other** card.
*   **Queen (Q):** Peek at any **one** card on the table. Then, swap any **one** card with any **other** card.
*   **Jack (J):** Swap any **one** card with any **other** card. (No peek).

#### **A. Skipping Abilities**
A player may choose to skip parts of their ability. For a King or Queen, they can skip the "peek" stage and proceed to the "swap" stage. They can also skip the "swap" stage, which ends the ability's effect.

#### **B. LIFO Stack Resolution (For Matched Special Cards)**
When one Special Card is matched on top of another, two abilities are triggered and placed on a stack. They resolve in **Last-In, First-Out (LIFO)** order.

*   **Example:** Alice discards a King. Bob successfully matches it with his own King.
    1.  Alice's King ability is triggered and placed on the stack first.
    2.  Bob's King ability is triggered and placed on top of Alice's.
    3.  **Bob resolves his ability first.**
    4.  After Bob's ability is finished, **Alice resolves her ability.**

## **9. Calling "Check" & Ending the Round**

#### **A. Player-Initiated "Check"**
On their turn, if no other actions are pending and the Final Turns phase has not yet begun, a player may choose to **"Call Check."**
*   This player is now the official **Check-caller**.
*   Their turn immediately ends.
*   They become **locked**. A locked player takes no more actions for the rest of the round.
*   The game enters the **Final Turns Phase**.

#### **B. Automatic "Check" (Empty Hand)**
If a player successfully makes a match that causes their hand to become empty, they automatically "Call Check."
*   They immediately become **locked**.
*   If this is the first "Check" of the round, they become the official Check-caller, and the game enters the **Final Turns Phase**.

#### **C. The Final Turns Phase**
Once "Check" has been called, every other eligible player gets to take **one last turn.**
*   The Check-caller is locked and does not get a final turn.
*   During a final turn, all standard gameplay rules apply, including the **Matching Stage** (Section 7) and **Special Card Abilities** (Section 8).
*   Players cannot manually "Call Check" during this phase.

#### **D. Locked Player State**
Once any player is `isLocked` (either by calling "Check" or emptying their hand), their hand cards **cannot be targeted** by opponents' Special Card abilities.

## **10. Scoring & Winning**

1.  After the Final Turns Phase is complete, the round ends and all players reveal their hands.
2.  Scores are calculated based on the card values in Section 4.
3.  The player or players with the **lowest total score** win(s) the round. In the event of a tie, all tied players are considered winners.
4.  The game consists of a single round.

## **11. Appendix: Edge Cases & Special Rulings**

*   **A. Empty Draw Pile:** If the Draw Pile becomes empty and a player needs to draw a card, the Discard Pile is immediately repurposed. The current top card of the Discard Pile is left in place, and all cards underneath it are shuffled to become the new face-down Draw Pile.
*   **B. Impossible Draw:** In the rare event that a player is required to draw a card (e.g., for a penalty) and no cards are available in either the Draw Pile or the Discard Pile to be reshuffled, the game ends immediately. All players proceed to the Scoring Phase with their current hands.
*   **C. Ability Fizzling:** If a player's turn to resolve a Special Ability comes up but they are `isLocked` (e.g., from a LIFO stack interaction), their ability does not trigger. It "fizzles" and is removed from the stack with no effect.
