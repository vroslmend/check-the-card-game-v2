# Server Testing Summary

This document summarizes the test coverage for the server components and outlines potential areas for further testing improvements.

## Current Test Coverage

1. **Game Machine (game-machine.test.ts)**
   - 52 comprehensive tests covering all aspects of game logic
   - Core game flow (player setup, dealing, turns)
   - Special card abilities (King, Queen, Jack)
   - Error recovery (empty deck, player disconnection)
   - Edge cases (LIFO ability resolution, locked players)

2. **State Redactor (state-redactor.test.ts)**
   - Verifies proper redaction of sensitive information from server state
   - Confirms players can only see their own cards fully
   - Validates deck information is properly summarized
   - Ensures game state fields are correctly preserved

3. **Deck Utilities (deck-utils.test.ts)**
   - Validates deck creation produces the correct 52-card structure
   - Ensures deck shuffling works properly
   - Verifies operations don't mutate original arrays

4. **Socket.IO Server (index.test.ts)**
   - Currently a placeholder for future Socket.IO server tests

## Testing Gaps and Future Improvements

1. **Socket.IO Server Testing**
   - Implement mock Socket.IO client and server for testing
   - Test player connection/disconnection handling
   - Test game instance creation and management
   - Verify proper event routing to game machine instances
   - Test broadcast functionality and message passing

2. **Integration Testing**
   - End-to-end tests that verify complete game flows
   - Test multiple concurrent game sessions
   - Verify proper cleanup of game instances

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Load tests with multiple concurrent games
   - Memory usage monitoring under heavy load
   - Connection handling under network stress

4. **Test Utilities**
   - Create helper functions for common test setup patterns
   - Implement snapshot testing for complex state comparisons

## Running Tests

Run the test suite using:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with UI
npm run test:ui

# Run tests and generate coverage report
npx vitest run --coverage
```

## Test Architecture

Our testing approach follows these principles:

1. **Behavior-Driven Testing**: Tests verify expected behavior according to game rules, not implementation details
2. **Independent Verification**: Tests are written against the specification in GAME_RULES.md
3. **XState-Specific Patterns**: Tests follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern for state machines
4. **Realistic Scenarios**: Tests simulate actual game flows rather than isolated function calls

When discrepancies are found between implementation and tests, we prioritize updating the implementation to match the expected behavior defined in the tests, not vice versa.
